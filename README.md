##Ad-Blocker Detection Demo

A very simple example of how to detect ad-blockers using the [BlockAdBlock](https://github.com/sitexw/BlockAdBlock) library.

I've written a [blog post](http://lukaswhite.com/blog/post/2016/how-detect-ad-blockers) which describes how to implement it; this code is designed to accompany that.

It's a one-pager, but you will need to install the library, which isn't included in this repository:

```
bower install
```
